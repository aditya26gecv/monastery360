    <h2>🌄 The Challenge</h2>
    <p>
      Nestled in the heart of the Himalayas, Sikkim is known for its breathtaking landscapes, vibrant culture, 
      and above all, its monasteries. With more than <strong>200 monasteries</strong> scattered across its 
      mountains and valleys, Sikkim holds centuries of Buddhist wisdom, traditions, art, and architecture.  
      These monasteries are not just religious centers—they are living heritage, spaces where 
      spirituality, community, and culture converge.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet, many of these sacred places remain out of reach for the world. Difficult terrains, 
      limited documentation, and lack of digital representation mean that their stories, 
      rituals, and cultural wealth are fading silently. 
    </p>

    <div class="highlight">
      The <strong>Smart India Hackathon Problem Statement #61</strong> calls upon us to 
      <strong>digitize and showcase Sikkim’s monasteries</strong>, ensuring their preservation 
      and global accessibility for generations to come.
    </div>

    <h2>🎯 Our Mission</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>Monastery 360</strong> is our vision of bringing Sikkim’s spiritual heritage 
      closer to the world. Through advanced digital tools, we aim to recreate the monastery experience— 
      allowing people to walk virtually inside sacred halls, admire intricate murals, 
      and understand the essence of Buddhist traditions without physical limitations.  
    </p>
    <p>
      More than just tourism, this project is about <strong>respect, preservation, 
      and cultural continuity</strong>. We want to ensure that the chants, colors, stories, 
      and festivals of these monasteries are never lost to time.
    </p>

    <h2>✨ What We Aim to Do</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>📸 Create immersive 360° tours of monasteries with high-quality visuals and audio guides.</li>
      <li>🌐 Provide global access to these monasteries via an interactive digital platform.</li>
      <li>📖 Document and archive traditions, manuscripts, festivals, and rituals shared by monks and local communities.</li>
      <li>🧭 Build smart maps and itineraries that help tourists plan monastery visits in Sikkim.</li>
      <li>🤝 Involve local artisans, monks, and storytellers in curating authentic cultural experiences.</li>
      <li>💻 Use emerging technologies like VR, AR, and AI chat-guides to make learning engaging and interactive.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>💡 Why It Matters</h2>
    <p>
      Every monastery in Sikkim tells a story—of resilience, faith, art, and community. 
      But in today’s fast-changing world, oral traditions are disappearing, murals are fading, 
      and younger generations are drifting away from their roots.  
    </p>
    <p>
      By digitizing monasteries, we are building a <strong>bridge between the past and the future</strong>.  
      Scholars will be able to study rare manuscripts, tourists can explore before visiting, 
      and children from around the world can learn about Buddhist values of peace and compassion.  
      Most importantly, local communities will see their heritage celebrated and sustained.  
    </p>

    <h2>🚀 The Impact</h2>
    <p>
      Once implemented, <strong>Monastery 360</strong> will:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>✅ Boost tourism by making monastery experiences accessible globally.</li>
      <li>✅ Provide researchers and students with rich cultural data and visual archives.</li>
      <li>✅ Create opportunities for local communities through digital storytelling and eco-tourism.</li>
      <li>✅ Ensure that cultural heritage is protected from loss, neglect, or modernization pressures.</li>
      <li>✅ Inspire global citizens to learn from and connect with Sikkim’s spiritual wisdom.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>🌏 Our Vision for the Future</h2>
    <p>
      We believe monasteries are more than just physical spaces—they are <strong>gateways 
      to wisdom and harmony</strong>. With Monastery 360, our dream is to transform Sikkim’s monasteries 
      into <strong>global cultural landmarks</strong> that inspire peace, unity, and understanding 
      across boundaries.
    </p>
    <p>
      As technology meets tradition, we are not just creating a project—we are crafting a 
      <strong>legacy of preservation, accessibility, and respect</strong>. A gift from Sikkim to the world.
